<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

This project was originally initiated under the influence of Google Developer Student Clubs and Microsoft Learn Student Ambassadors - SSUET campus to teach more and more students about technology. Over the internet, there are great resources to learn Machine Learning, but what it lacks is the proper flow in their road map, which triggers the students to give up in the half way mostly.

This project is created to let student have a quickest and easiest handsa on journey with Machine Learning using Python3. However, currently notebook doesn't possess any Mathematical material, but we surely be digging on it with other experienced ML writers to help through out that process.

The end goal of this repository is just 3 hours per day and only 30 days, and you will be best with Machine Learning, you may have never imagined.


### Built With

The entire project (course) is focused on Python 3. (We recommend Python 3.6 to 3.8), following some famously required packages in Python. And the most important ingredient here is LOVE. 

* [Python](https://www.python.org/)
* [Jupyter Notebooks](https://jupyter.org/)
* [Scikit Learn](https://scikit-learn.org/)
* [Tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org/)
* [Love](https://vilee.fi/eng/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/whatislove-960x640-1.jpg)

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

Install [Python 3.8X](https://www.python.org/downloads/source/) in your local machine. Once done. Open terminal and run 
 
  ```cd
  pip install jupyternotebook
  ```
